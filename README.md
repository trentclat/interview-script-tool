# Interview Application

A web application for conducting structured interviews.

## Setup Instructions

1. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
- Windows:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```
- Mac/Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the application:
```bash
python app.py
```

5. Open your web browser and go to:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

The application runs in debug mode, which means it will automatically reload when you make changes to the code.
