## BAD TECH

### Q: What piece of technology do you not feel comfortable using or dislike?
A: I honestly dislike the face ID feature just because  sometimes when you're trying to swipe up on your phone it keeps prompting you to ask for your face when for example you don't want to do that or you have a mask on or  you know bunch of other reasons 

### Q: Did you dislike using it right away, or did your negative feelings develop over time?
A: so I  at first I kind of liked it but then over time I started kind of noticing the disadvantages and  kind of got annoyed it was a pretty cool feature at the beginning but then it just kind of got annoying 

### Q: Was this technology easy to learn and start using initially?
A: yeah pretty easy 

### Q: What aspects made it user-friendly for beginners?
A: there's not much to it you know you just put your face and take a stand 

### Q: What aspects made it confusing or difficult for beginners?
A: it was a really difficult just more inconvenient I'd say 

### Q: Did this technology replace something else that performed the same function? If so, what was it and how do they compare?
A: so I guess the face ID kind of replaced the home button or the touch ID  and  I mean they do perform the same function but  the  you know the face ID is I just think more inconvenient but they both have pros and cons you know 

### Q: What problem were you trying to solve when you started using this technology?
A: I personally wasn't trying to solve any problems but I guess their goal was to you know stop you know allow people to open their phone without having to use their hands I guess that was the main idea behind the future 

### Q: Do you feel there are missing features in this technology? What would you add and how should it work?
A: so the I would I wouldn't say there's any missing features as you know they added mask identification and all of that but  sometimes it just for some reason does not recognize your face either the lenses dirty or you know you've just got something obstructing your face so I maybe something that just you know focuses on your eyes for example I'm not too sure 

### Q: Do you think this technology has too many features? Which ones would you remove or make less prominent?
A: okay skip 

### Q: Despite your overall dislike, are there any elements of this technology that you actually appreciate?
A: I mean sometimes yeah when my hands are dirty and you know I don't want to touch my phone it's kind of convenient to just  put your face and open your phone

### Q: How did the technology you disliked work, and do you still have to use it?
A: so you had to First be connected to the same internet from the device you're printing on in the printer and then  you have to navigate through this horrible  one by one  screen that  didn't work half the time  and and then you press a few buns and you had to connect to the internet every single time and  that's how it worked and then you print

## LEARNING STYLE

### Q: Generally, how easy do you find it to learn new technology?
A: I mean I find it pretty easy as a  young guy I'd say so and I can  fuck I'm pretty accustomed with the new developments and  I can figure something out pretty quick 

### Q: Why do you think you have this level of ease or difficulty with learning new technology?
A: yeah so kind of the same as what I just said I just you know as we as new technology comes out we're kind of in the Forefront of all the all this technology so  we get exposed to it pretty early and  it's pretty easy to figure things out I'd say 

### Q: What's your preferred method for learning how to use new technology?
A: just you know click on things and  you know ask it if if applicable you could ask it some things just play around to that you know that's how you learn anything 

### Q: How do you feel about step-by-step tutorials?
A: step by step tutorials could be very helpful especially when it comes down to complex Technologies I mean I'd say I used tutorials maybe 80% of the time when it comes to new technology but sometimes you know if you've got something complicated then it would be a lifesaver to have a step by step tutorial 

### Q: How do you feel about written instructions?
A: I'd say ran instructions  are  not as good as step by step tutorials but  you know it differs when you're exploring  different types of Technologies 

### Q: How do you feel about illustrated instructions?
A: they're kind of weird I don't  you know they you might as well just make a video 

### Q: How do you feel about instructional videos?
A: instructional videos like I just said pretty good yeah 

### Q: How do you feel about live typed chat support?
A: worst thing to ever exist they give you the worst answers possible and I deeply hate them 

### Q: How do you feel about online forums for help?
A: best best thing ever you know whenever you're trying to solve a problem I read it is always number one stop 

### Q: How do you feel about one-on-one in-person training?
A: that would be I mean depending on how complex the technology is that would be kind of weird if I had a one-on-one with someone trying to teach me how to use a phone but then if someone's trying to teach me how to use a lathe or a male then that's a completely different story and also very important thing to have yeah 

### Q: How do you feel about group in-person training?
A: I could be helpful you know you could  help each other you know being in an environment with the people just as clueless as you is always a good thing because you can all you know grow together 

### Q: How do you feel about gamified learning with levels and badges?
A: haha  I think that could I think that could be really fun you know like  I could  make things feel a bit less serious and just you know  at a at the bit of salt and pepper to the instructions 

### Q: Some technology assumes you're a beginner and introduces features gradually, while others assume expertise and let you explore. Which approach do you prefer and why?
A: I mean I'd say I'd say generally it would be better to start for the technology to assume you're a beginner because if you're an expert then you won't have an issue going through the beginner stages but if you're a beginner you're going to have a lot of a lot of trouble  going through the expertise stages  so you know I'd say either let the user pick or just start off  with the big with the beginner stages or with the assumption that the users of beginner
