## BAD TECH

### Q: What piece of technology do you not feel comfortable using or dislike?
A: I have mixed feelings about my banking website i use to check everything like bills and my balance. 

### Q: Did you dislike using it right away, or did your negative feelings develop over time?
A: yeah overall I do like it, it's much easier than having to go to the bank everyday or you know having to call them if you have a question you can just log in and check your balance and
and make sure everything's good and make sure when a check has been processed you can see when they do clear and they have a picture of the check and everything. 

### Q: Was this technology easy to learn and start using initially?
A: yeah it it was different because I was always used to you know going to the bank in person, so trusting the process I guess ... trusting the technology was hard for me because  
I grew up in a time where we just always went to the bank. I guess i had a hard time trusting the technology at first, when they would ask me to input my information like my credit cards and everything, 
it didn't feel safe at first 

### Q: What aspects made it user-friendly for beginners?
A: yeah so they do really good job making it user friendly with it being pretty organized and having you know the different columns you can click on and you know a check your balance tab 
and you know if you have questions about something they have a support line you can reach

### Q: What aspects made it confusing or difficult for beginners?
A: I still don't know how to cash a check via the website, if somebody gives me a check and i have to cash it through take a picture of it and send it I always have to go to the bank 
and I just feel more comfortable about that.  I guess that's one thing about the difficulty with the site. 

### Q: Did this technology replace something else that performed the same function? If so, what was it and how do they compare?
A: yes, the bank, Duh

### Q: What problem were you trying to solve when you started using this technology?
A: I mean I knew it would be easier to be able to check my balance you know every day every other day watch the checks coming in watch you know with my job watch the deposits coming in 
making sure I'm getting paid because with my job I have the direct deposit so that means it's going straight to my checking account so  keeping tabs on that too was easier then driving to the bank 
everyday to check my balance 

### Q: Do you feel there are missing features in this technology? What would you add and how should it work?
A: I can't think of anything right it's pretty user friendly yeah cuz you can apply for a loan on it and you can  you can get your statements like you can go back 5 years or 3 years and get your
 statements you know all the records you know  so they make it they make it really easy to do everything you want

### Q: Do you think this technology has too many features? Which ones would you remove or make less prominent?
A: No i think overall there's just enough

## EMOTIONS

### Q: How does the prospect of having to use new technology make you feel?
A: yeah and it it seems like once you get used to something then they always upgrade or they always change it in order to optimize the software or something.  
yeah I don't like change when it comes to technology because once I learn it one way that's all i know. anytime they change one thing i feel like i have to relearn the whole thing *laughs in embarassment*

### Q: Why do you think you feel this way about new technology?
A: yeah it's definitely my age I didn't grow up with all this so it's  yeah it's  it's a totally totally different 

### Q: What's the best piece of technology you can remember using? Why did you like it so much?
A: probably back when I was a court reporter because back then they were just introducing all this software for computers and my court reporting software had the capacity to work with me
 as I was reporting and taking a deposition, it was coming up on my laptop in English and I had to go in there and put in all the words but the software,  that software knew that
 that the buttons I push translated into English  so that was the that was the first Software System I ever worked on and that  was like 35 years ago 

### Q: How did your favorite technology work, and do you still use it today?
A: i feel like i just answered that hahahh

### Q: If your favorite technology no longer exists, why do you think it disappeared?
A: yeah they you know there's getting to be less and less court reporters because I think they're they're just doing other things to take down the depositions or  
doing you know they're just not having that person there anymore, everything is being taken over my these technologies 

### Q: What's the worst piece of technology you can remember using? Why did you dislike it so much?
A: probably the first Macintosh when it came out. I remember  using that thing and having no idea what was going on just because it was something so completely new to me 

### Q: How did the technology you disliked work, and do you still have to use it?
A:  yeah I don't use it anymore , but yeah it was just kind of hard because I mean it was just computers back 
then we're just very  new to our generation and  it was very much of a learning curve  going to grade school and high school they were 
just starting to introduce computers when I was in high school, so it was all very new to me

## LEARNING STYLE

### Q: Generally, how easy do you find it to learn new technology?
A: yeah and it's getting easier you know every company has their own software so if you switch jobs  you're nine times out of 10 going to have to learn there  Software System
 because a lot of companies have different software systems, so if they teach you how to use it then i'm okay with it. But when i'm on my own i find it more difficult

### Q: Why do you think you have this level of ease or difficulty with learning new technology?
A: it's definitely my age you know and what you're used to and  yeah that's that's basically you know back in when I was growing up we didn't have we didn't 
have phones so you know  it's it's a lot different 

### Q: What's your preferred method for learning how to use new technology?
A:  yeah and definitely you know I like to research it on the computer you know  Google it YouTube it  
see what you know the easiest or you go you know go to Barnes & Noble and buy a book about it 

### Q: How do you feel about step-by-step tutorials?
A: yeah I like that when they're very step by step this is how you do it I like that  that's the way I like to learn 

### Q: How do you feel about written instructions?
A: yeah i prefer written instructions just because its on paper you know its just simpler i guess 

### Q: How do you feel about illustrated instructions?
A: yes those are great yeah

### Q: How do you feel about instructional videos?
A: yeah I like instructional videos those work really well too so and helpful  so yeah no I like those too 

### Q: How do you feel about live typed chat support?
A: yeah I just don't like talking to a robot i would rather talk to a real person in real life. but yeah i understand why they have that. but i just don't like that i would rather just
research my own problem i have with the technology

### Q: How do you feel about online forums for help?
A: i usually don't go to these , but they probabaly have some useful information from people who use the thing a lot 

### Q: How do you feel about one-on-one in-person training?
A: yeah that's number one preference

### Q: How do you feel about gamified learning with levels and badges?
A: at lifetime when I was at Lifetime Fitness working  every year we had throughout the year every six months we had to do like new training on the computer and
they went through it kind of like a game wher we  earned little badges, i thought it was fun i guess 

### Q: Some technology assumes you're a beginner and introduces features gradually, while others assume expertise and let you explore. Which approach do you prefer and why?
A: i like having a step by step guide because i'm a slow learer when it comes to uhm yeah when it comes to new technology. i get overwhelmed when they throw everything at me at once
